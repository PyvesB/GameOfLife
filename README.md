# GameOfLife

A simple concurrent implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in Scala and using a toroidal grid. You can easily set the size of the grid and the number of threads operating in parallel, as well as modify the initial pattern of the grid (simply edit the values in GameOfLife.scala). The concurrency is based on barrier synchronisation.
